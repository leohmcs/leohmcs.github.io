Hello, I am Leo. I'm an Electrical Engineering student at [Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)](https://ufmg.br/) :brazil:. During my undergrad, I also spent a semester abroad at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) :sweden:.

I am interested in building robots that interact with humans, particularly in how we can guarantee safety in those interactions. My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics, control theory and machine learning.

As an undergrad, I had the privilege to be a [Robotics Institute Summer Scholar](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) (RISS) in 2023 and 2024 at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I worked with [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/) and [Andrea Bajcsy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abajcsy/), respectively. I also had the pleasure to work with [Douglas Macharet](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~doug/site/en/) at UFMG, and with [Jana Tumova](https://sites.google.com/view/janatumova/home) while at KTH.

During RISS, I was also an organizer of the [RoboLaunch](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/robolaunch/) outreach initiative that brings leading robotics and AI researchers from around the world to present their work in accessible talks.

Apart from research, I enjoy playing and watching football (soccer), reading literature, and being outside whenever I can find an excuse.
